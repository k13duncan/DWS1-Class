    <p id="main">Oil City Pennsylvania is a Very small town with nothing to do in it, it is my home town so I am allowed to talk down on this
    lovely place. There is a good side of Oil City though, it is beautiful. It is located in a valley and split by a river called the
    Allegheny, the seasons there don't get any better. There is still a lot of wildlife in this area and a lot of woodland areas the
    spread for miles upon miles.</p>

        <h2 id="positives">The positives behind Oil City</h2>
        <p>Oil city like I said before is beautiful, with the giant hill like mountains covered in trees that change for each season. Does
        not matter what time of the year it is in Oil City the ceanory is beautiful. The river that runs through the city is beautiful too
        creating lots of outdoor activities, like swimming, fishing, jetsking, tubing and just relaxing by the river. Oil City is also a
        great place to live if you like the outdoor sports such as hunting, fishing and trapping. There is a lot of wildlife in the area that
        gives people something to look forward to year around when seasons open to the public.</p>

        <h2 id="negatives">The negatives behind Oil City</h2>
        <p>There are some bad things about living in Oil City, like the fact that there is nothing to do other then the things I named in the
        positives paragraph. You have too travel about an hour to find a mall, or somewhere nice to eat or anything really. The bars are full
        of your old life long Oil City folks, and don't be mistaken, you would think small town full of nice people and friendly people that
        everyone knows but because it is so small everyone knows everyone else's dirty laundry. When I say dirty laundry i mean their secrets
        which makes everyone judgemental and then everyone starts saying things behind everyone else's backs. It's just not cool living there
        for over 15 years because eventually everyone knows everything about you and instead of being your friends they will look down on everyone.

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p>Oil City used to be a huge crude oil transport area, also had one of the biggest oil wells in Pennsylvania. The name of the town kinda gives
        that away though don't you think? There was a huge pennzoil plant there but in the late 80's it blew up killing the business and lot of workers lost their jobs
        making the towns last hope go up in flames. It is a very old town still having the really big houses from the high end families lives in when the town was a
        booming oil transport. They used the river that ran though the little city to make a lot of their transports to bigger cities south of us like Pittsburgh.
        In the early 17th century, the Seneca nation first settled in the region; by, the late 18th century Chief Cornplanter was given three tracts of land as
        a "gift" from the State of Pennsylvania. In 1818, local prospectors purchased the land and built a blast furnace, which closed in the early 1850s. As
        population in the area began to decline, Colonel Edwin L. Drake drilled the first commercially successful oil well on August 27, 1859, in nearby Titusville.
        A number of boomtowns came to life in the region, including Oil City, Titusville, Petroleum Center, Pithole, and Rynd Farm.
