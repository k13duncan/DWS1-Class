    <h1>Zen Garden Reviews</h1>
    <p><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com">Zen Garden</a> CSS design site viewed and reviewed by a beginner CSS and HTML developer.</p>
    <h2>The First Zen Garden Reviewed</h2>
    <p>The first page I visited was called <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/213/213.css">Under the Sea</a>.
        As you cal tell by the name it was an under water, with a old salty look too it. Like pirate map look.
        It was well put together by using the over all background looked like an ocean leading to the beach. The layout was easier to
        read and follow through the page. All the headings had background images the followed the flow of the site.
    </p>
    <h2>The Second Zen Garden Reviewed</h2>
    <p> The second page I had visited was <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/200/200.css">Icicle Outback</a>. The
        layout for this one was a snow chilled look with icicles hanging in the background and the boarders. The use of the boarders
        on all the information was very well laid out, and easy to read. Navagating through this site was easy and was nice to look
        at which is always a plus.
    </p>
    <h2>The Third Zen Garden Reviewed</h2>
    <p>The third and last page i visited in the Zen garden was <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/193/193.css">Leggo My Ego</a>.
       This site had a white plain background with a leggo looking design in the back, the heading looked like it came out of the
        chimney like smoke and all the fonts in the headings were trying to match the over all look of the leggo concept. They overall layout
        was a great idea, it is very interesting and creative. Lets someone use the site and enjoy looking at it but it keeps the design
        throughout the entire site and does it well, like this design.
