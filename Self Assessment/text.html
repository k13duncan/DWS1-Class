    <h1>The Giant Squid</h1>

    <p>The <strong>giant squid</strong> (genus: <i>Architeuthis</i>) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family
        <i>Architeuthidae</i>, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see Deep-sea <i>gigantism</i>):
    recent estimates put the maximum size at <abbr title="43 ft">13 m</abbr>  for females and <abbr title="33 ft">10 m</abbr>  for males from the posterior
    fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated <abbrtitle="46 ft">14 m</abbr>,
    one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about <abbr title="6.6 ft">2 m</abbr>  long (<i>more for females, less for males</i>),
    and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about <abbr title="16 ft">5 m</abbr>. Claims of specimens measuring<abbr title="66 ft"> 20 m</abbr>
    or more have <strong>not</strong> been scientifically documented.</p>

    <p>On 30 September 2004, researchers from the<acronym title="Museum of Nature and Science"> NMNS </acronym> of Tokyo,
Japan and the <acronym title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</acronym> took the first images of a live giant
squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later.
The NMNS and OWA successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.</p>
