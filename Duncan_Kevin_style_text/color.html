       <h3>Information From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(comics)#Powers_and_abilities">Wiki</a></h3>
        <p>Albert Simmons was a marine, who had accomplished many things while in the marines that put him in the position of
           Lieutenant Colonel. After the marines he was picked up by the CIA, he became a top assassin. Later in his career he
           went on a mission and didn't come back alive. He was sent to hell for the bad things he had done in his life but was
           brought back by a demon that would watch over him, making sure he did what he was suppose to do.</p>
    <h2 id="Tim">The Suit</h2>
         <div>
        <p>His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(comics)#Powers_and_abilities">powers</a> all stem from his suit.
            His main powers were superhuman strength, weight, stamina, and healing. Even though he was heavy, weight wise because
             of the suit, he was very quick, could fly, in certain comics, he had teleportation and could bring back the dead.
         </p> </div>
    <h2 id="Joe">What Makes Spawn Different From Other Superheros</h2>

          <p>He does not look like your normal superhero, he looks like something from hell. Oh wait, he is from hell. He is a Hell
             Spawned soul. He is wearing a long red cape like you see in a lot of heroes but it is very very long and retractable
             for most of the series. He has a black suit the is either cover in chains, skulls or both. His eyes glow green like
             a green flame. Spawn feeds off of things that are bad, like bad thought, bad human
             souls and the bad animals souls such as </p>
          <ul>
            <li>rats</li>
            <li>bats</li>
            <li>roaches</li>
            <li>worms</li>
            <li>insects</li>
            <li>wolves</li>
            <li>snakes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>He feeds on souls to recharge his suit. Like most heroes all the power he gets is from the suit but the suit becomes him
          , or he becomes the suit I should say.
          </p>
    <h2 id="Rit">Villians</h2>
        <div><p>There are two main bad guys in the stories of spawn, one is Violator, the first of five born demons. He resembles a really creepy
        fat clown. The second is Satan which looks like a giant beast most of the time in the comics.
